# BookTracker-DataFetcher

## Description:
This repository contains a python script that can be used to extractct certain data from the Apple/IOS BookTracker BookShelf Desktop App. I personally use BookTracker to track my reading goals, page counts, and to generally catagorize and organize my books. I had a need to gather some base data about each book and especially wanted to be able to extract the Quotes that I had input into Booktracker, and built this script to do just that.

## Pre-Requisites:
There are no pre-requisites to running this script. All of the included libraries are Python built-in librarires. No pip installs required. It is HIGHLY advisable that you copy your BookTracker database and run this script against the copy. While no write operations are present in the execution of this script, its always safer to run external scripts against a database backup or copy instaead of the live version that is stored on iCloud. You must also be using the Desktop version of the app to execute this script. Upon installing the desktop app, the database file can be found in the following location once the Desktop app has been installed:  ```/Users/{USERNAME}/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.simonemontalto.booktrack.coredata/library.sqlite```

## Variables:
* BookTrackDB - Variable to reference the location of the Booktracker application sqlite database.
* Query - Query to run against the Booktracker application sqlite database.
* QuotesOutputFile - Variable to reference the output location where the Quotes JSON output will be written
* BooksOutputFile - Variable to reference the output location where the Books JSON output will be written

## Output:
The script outputs a file that has a focus around quotes, and another file that has a focus around the books stored in the App. Examples of both can be found below.

Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia to be raised in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. \"\"The best of all the Greeks\"\"\u2014strong, beautiful, and the child of a goddess\u2014Achilles is everything the shamed Patroclus is not. Yet despite their differences, the boys become steadfast companions. Their bond deepens as they grow into young men and become skilled in the arts of war and medicine\u2014much to the displeasure and the fury of Achilles' mother, Thetis, a cruel sea goddess with a hatred of mortals.</p><p>When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece, bound by blood and oath, must lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.</p><p>Built on the groundwork of the Iliad, Madeline Miller's page-turning, profoundly moving, and blisteringly paced retelling of the epic Trojan War marks the launch of a dazzling career.</p><p>Please note that due to the large file size of these special features this enhanced e-book may take longer to download then a standard e-book.</p>",

R. Martin's monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in <i>A Feast for Crows</i>, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction.<br><br><b>A FEAST FOR CROWS<br><br></b>It seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King's Landing. Robb Stark's demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist\u2014or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. <br><br>But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces\u2014some familiar, others only just appearing\u2014are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead. <br><br>It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives. For at a feast for crows, many are the guests\u2014but only a few are the survivors.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",
